# Objectives:
- Efficiently handle requests
- Search for optimal algorithms: Use scheduling algorithms to decide the operation of the lift
- Prioritise requests based on factors such as direction of travel, proximity to the
call, and waiting times
- Implement a simulation: this should simulate real scenatrios with multiple passengers requesting the lift. there should also be real-world constraints such as capacity limits and the time taken to move between floors
- Generate charts showing the efficiency of the algorithms
- Develop a GUI to visualise the simulation and lift's movements

# Requirements:
- An algorithm that converts an input file into valid json
- An algorithm that checks that the input file is valid and if it is not describe how it should be corrected
- At least two algorithms that take all passengers from their floors to their requested floors in a valid manner
- Each algorithm must display its stops and show who was picked up and dropped off at each floor
- Each algorithm takes into account capacity of the lift making sure that the lift only takes on the maxium amount of passengers at a time
- A chart showing the efficiency of at least two of the algorithms
- A GUI that visualises the movement of the lift, clearly indicating what is on the lift and when it stops
